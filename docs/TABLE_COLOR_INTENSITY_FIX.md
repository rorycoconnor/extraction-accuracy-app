# Table Color Intensity & Legend Brightness Fix

## üêõ Problem

After implementing dark mode, the user reported two issues:

1. **Colors too subtle** - Table cell colors (green, red, blue, yellow) needed to stand out more in dark mode, but not as bright as light mode
2. **Legend text too dim** - Legend text was using `text-muted-foreground` which was hard to read

**User feedback:** "colors needs to stand out a little more. but not as bright as the light mode. also legend text needs to be brighter..."

---

## ‚úÖ Solution

1. Increased color opacity from `/30` to `/50` in dark mode for better visibility
2. Lightened text colors from `-300` to `-200` for better contrast
3. Changed legend text from `text-muted-foreground` to `text-foreground`
4. Strengthened legend box borders from `-700` to `-600`

## üîß Changes Made

### File: `comparison-results.tsx`

#### Legend Updates (Lines 101-117)

**1. Legend Label Text:**
```tsx
// Before
<span className="font-medium text-muted-foreground">Legend:</span>

// After
<span className="font-medium text-foreground">Legend:</span>
```

**2. All Legend Item Labels:**
```tsx
// Before
<span className="text-muted-foreground">Match</span>

// After
<span className="text-foreground">Match</span>
```

**3. Legend Color Boxes - Increased Opacity & Stronger Borders:**
```tsx
// Before - Green (Match)
dark:bg-green-900/30 border ... dark:border-green-700

dark:bg-green-900/50 border ... dark:border-green-600

// Same pattern for Yellow, Blue, and Red
```

## ‚úÖ Benefits

1. **Better Visibility** - Colors now stand out 66% more in dark mode
2. **Improved Readability** - Legend text is bright and clear
3. **Better Contrast** - Lighter text colors on colored backgrounds
4. **Balanced** - More visible than before, but not as bright as light mode
5. **User Satisfaction** - Addresses both user concerns directly

## üìù Design Balance

The sweet spot for dark mode colors:
- **Too subtle** (`/20`, `/30`) - Hard to see differences
- **Just right** (`/40`, `/50`) - ‚úÖ Clear but comfortable
- **Too bright** (`/70`, `/80`, `/100`) - Eye strain, harsh

We chose `/50` (50% opacity) which provides:
- Clear color differentiation
- Comfortable viewing
- Professional appearance
- Not overwhelming

---
