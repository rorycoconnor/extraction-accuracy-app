## üö® Critical Reminders

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MUST DO
1. **Read summary document first** - Don't skip to implementation
2. **Verify Box AI unchanged** - Check comparison document
3. **Test thoroughly** - Follow testing strategy
4. **Document baseline** - Measure before/after
5. **Feature flags ready** - Enable rollback capability

### ‚ùå MUST NOT DO
1. **Change Box AI request format** - It's working, leave it alone
2. **Skip Week 1** - Logging is critical for production
3. **Rush implementation** - Follow the plan
4. **Skip testing** - Comprehensive tests required
5. **Deploy without staging** - Test in staging first

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: Which document should I read first?
**A**: Start with [`ORCHESTRATION_PLAN_SUMMARY.md`](./ORCHESTRATION_PLAN_SUMMARY.md) for overview.

### Q: Do we have to do all 4 weeks?
**A**: Week 1 is critical. Weeks 2-4 are prioritized by impact.

### Q: Will this break Box AI?
**A**: No. See "Box AI Integration UNCHANGED" section in comparison doc.

### Q: Can we do this in parallel with feature work?
**A**: Week 1 can be done quickly. Weeks 2-4 depend on sprint capacity.

### Q: What if we find issues during implementation?
**A**: Feature flags allow rollback. Testing strategy catches issues early.

### Q: How do we measure success?
**A**: Specific metrics in each document (logs, types, performance, etc.)
