- **Prompt Versioning System**: Advanced prompt management with version control, history tracking, and performance metrics for iterative prompt optimization.
- **Automated Prompt Generation**: AI-powered prompt generation using Google's Power Prompts techniques, with automatic reasoning about document content and template requirements.
- **Multi-Model AI Integration**: Support for multiple AI models (Box AI Default, Google Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro, AWS Claude 3.5 Sonnet) with real-time comparison capabilities.
- Ground Truth Interface: Ground Truth Management interface where users can add, edit, and delete ground truth for file metadata, including a side-by-side view with Box document preview (using Box Element Preview).
- Performance Metrics Calculation: Calculate and display metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score) for each document or metadata field extracted to evaluate the AI model performance.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 75%, 50%) - RGB(21, 125, 214). This bright, saturated blue suggests technological focus, information access, and optimized solutions.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 95%) - RGB(242, 245, 247). Very light desaturated blue provides a neutral backdrop that conveys objectivity.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 65%, 50%) - RGB(33, 191, 191). This contrasting cyan can highlight key actions and metrics, implying the freshness and clarity of insight.
- Body text: 'Inter' sans-serif; a neutral font that emphasizes the objectivity of the displayed data
- Headline Font: 'Space Grotesk', for an elegant modern style that compliments the sans-serif choice for body text
- Use minimalist, geometric icons to represent different metadata fields and functions. Icons should be consistent with the overall modern and clean design.
- Maintain a clean, well-spaced layout for the data table. Use clear visual hierarchy to distinguish between file names, metadata fields, and extraction results.
