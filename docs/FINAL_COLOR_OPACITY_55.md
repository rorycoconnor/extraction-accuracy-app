## ✅ Final Decision

After testing multiple opacity levels, we've settled on **55% opacity** for all table cell background colors in dark mode.

## 📊 Opacity Testing Journey

| Attempt | Opacity | User Feedback | Result |
|---------|---------|---------------|--------|
| Initial | 30% | Too subtle | ❌ |
| Update 1 | 50% | Still hard to see | ❌ |
| Update 2 | 70% | Getting better but still faint | ❌ |
| Update 3 | 90% | Too much! Standing out too much | ❌ |
| Update 4 | 80% | Better but still a bit much | ❌ |
| **Final** | **55%** | **Perfect balance** | ✅ |

## 🎨 Final Color Configuration

All comparison cell backgrounds now use **55% opacity** in dark mode:

```tsx
// Cell Backgrounds (getCellBackgroundColor function)
Match (Green):         dark:bg-green-900/55
Mismatch (Red):        dark:bg-red-900/55
Partial Match (Blue):  dark:bg-blue-900/55
Different Format (Yellow): dark:bg-yellow-900/55
Error States:          dark:bg-red-900/55

// Text Colors
All cell text:         dark:text-*-50 (lightest shade)

// Legend Boxes
All 4 legend colors:   dark:bg-*-900/55
All borders:           dark:border-*-400 (visible but not harsh)

// Performance Badges
Accuracy >90%:         dark:bg-green-900/55
Accuracy 70-89%:       dark:bg-yellow-900/55
Accuracy <70%:         dark:bg-red-900/55
```

## 🎯 Why 55% Works

**55% opacity hits the sweet spot:**
- ✅ **Visible** - Colors are clearly distinguishable
- ✅ **Subtle** - Not overwhelming or harsh
- ✅ **Professional** - Looks polished and refined
- ✅ **Comfortable** - Easy on eyes for extended viewing
- ✅ **Balanced** - Between "hard to see" and "too much"

**Comparison:**
- **50%** - Just slightly too subtle
- **55%** - Perfect! ✨
- **60%** - Would work too, but 55% is ideal
- **70%** - Getting too bright
- **80-90%** - Way too intense

## 📊 Visual Impact

### Table Cells:
- **Green (matches)** - Clearly visible success indicators
- **Red (mismatches)** - Obviously stand out as issues
- **Blue (partial)** - Easy to spot partial matches
- **Yellow (different format)** - Recognizable format differences

### Legend:
- All 4 color indicators match table cells perfectly
- Bright borders (`-400` shade) make boxes clearly defined
- Text is bright white for maximum readability

### Performance Badges:
- Accuracy badges in Field Averages row are visible
- Easy to scan and spot high/low performers
- Consistent with table cell opacity

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Opacity is the brightness control** - `/55` = 55% visible
2. **Dark mode requires subtlety** - Anything over 70% can be harsh
3. **Test incrementally** - We tested 30, 50, 70, 80, 90, then settled on 55
4. **Text color matters** - Using `-50` (lightest) ensures readability
5. **Consistency is key** - All elements using same opacity creates harmony

## 🎨 Model Performance Summary Report

The Model Performance Summary modal is **already fully styled** for dark mode:
- ✅ Model cards with proper dark backgrounds
- ✅ Accuracy badges with dark variants
- ✅ Field performance cells (green/blue/red)
- ✅ Summary insights section
- ✅ All borders and text properly themed

**No changes needed** - report looks great!

## 📝 Code Pattern (Final)

```tsx
// ✅ FINAL PATTERN - 55% opacity
// Cell backgrounds
dark:bg-green-900/55   // Green for matches
dark:bg-red-900/55     // Red for mismatches  
dark:bg-blue-900/55    // Blue for partial
dark:bg-yellow-900/55  // Yellow for format diff

// Text on colored backgrounds
dark:text-*-50         // Lightest shade

// Borders
dark:border-*-400      // Medium-bright borders

// This creates the perfect balance!
```
