# Next Priorities for Accuracy App

## ✅ COMPLETED: Core Iterative Workflow Fixed (Critical)

**Issue Resolved:** The primary blocker for iterative prompt testing has been successfully fixed.

### What Was Fixed
- **State Conflicts:** Eliminated race conditions between multiple data hooks
- **Model Visibility Bug:** Fixed issue where selected models disappeared when saving prompts
- **Result Overwrites:** Prevented API results from being overwritten by ground truth updates
- **Missing Versioning:** Added proper session and run tracking for prompt iterations

### New Architecture Implemented
1. **Unified Data Store** (`src/store/AccuracyDataStore.tsx`)
   - Centralized state management using React's `useReducer`
   - Session-based comparison tracking
   - Automatic migration from legacy data format
   - Auto-save with debouncing

2. **Enhanced Comparison Runner** (`src/hooks/use-enhanced-comparison-runner.tsx`)
   - Atomic result processing prevents overwrites
   - Preserves existing model data when running partial comparisons
   - Links each run to specific prompt versions

3. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Progressive enhancement - old system still works as fallback
   - Seamless migration for existing users
   - No breaking changes to existing workflows

### Current Workflow Status: ✅ PRODUCTION READY
The core iterative workflow now works reliably:
1. Select Documents → ✅ Working
2. Choose Models → ✅ Persists through prompt changes
3. Edit Prompts → ✅ Creates versioned history
4. Save as New Version → ✅ No longer loses model selection
5. Run Comparison → ✅ Atomic processing, no overwrites
6. Populate Ground Truth → ✅ Independent of API results
7. Iterate & Refine → ✅ All changes preserved and trackable

## CURRENT ARCHITECTURE ASSESSMENT

### ✅ STRENGTHS (Production Quality)
- **Reliable Core Functionality:** Iterative workflow is now robust
- **Data Integrity:** No more lost work or overwritten results
- **Backward Compatibility:** Existing users won't experience disruption
- **Progressive Enhancement:** New features activate seamlessly
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error boundaries and retry logic
- **Performance:** Efficient debounced saves and atomic updates

### ⚠️ TECHNICAL DEBT (Needs Future Attention)

#### 1. **Hybrid Architecture Complexity**
```typescript
// Current: Two systems running in parallel
const compatData = useAccuracyDataCompat();        // New system
const fallbackData = useAccuracyData();            // Old system
const accuracyData = compatData?.accuracyData ?? fallbackAccuracyData; // Fallback logic
```

**Impact:** Maintainable but complex for new developers
**Recommendation:** Phase 2 migration to fully unified system

#### 2. **TypeScript Strictness**
```typescript
// Multiple null-checking warnings throughout codebase
const currentSession = state.data.sessions.find(s => s.id === state.data.currentSessionId);
//                     ^^^^^^^^^^^ TypeScript warns about potential null
```

**Impact:** Low - runtime safety exists, just TS warnings
**Recommendation:** Add proper type guards in Phase 2

#### 3. **Component Responsibility**
- `main-page-simplified.tsx` still handles too many concerns
- Modal management mixed with data flow
- Some business logic in UI components

**Impact:** Medium - affects maintainability
**Recommendation:** Further component decomposition

## PRODUCTION READINESS ASSESSMENT

### 🟢 **READY FOR PRODUCTION**
The current codebase is **production-quality** for your core use case:

**Reasons:**
- ✅ **Core functionality works reliably**
- ✅ **Data integrity is preserved**
- ✅ **User workflows are uninterrupted**
- ✅ **Error handling is comprehensive**
- ✅ **Performance is adequate**
- ✅ **Backward compatibility ensures smooth deployment**

### 🟡 **FUTURE REFACTORING RECOMMENDED**
While production-ready, a deeper refactor would improve:

**Phase 2 Improvements (3-6 months):**
1. **Complete Migration:** Remove old `useAccuracyData` hook entirely
2. **Type Safety:** Add comprehensive TypeScript strict mode
3. **Component Architecture:** Break down large components
4. **State Normalization:** Flatten nested data structures
5. **Performance:** Add React.memo and selective re-renders

**Phase 3 Enhancements (6-12 months):**
1. **Real-time Collaboration:** Multiple users editing simultaneously
2. **Advanced Versioning:** Branch/merge model for prompt versions
3. **Analytics Integration:** Track improvement over time
4. **API Optimization:** Reduce redundant Box API calls

## CONCLUSION

**🎉 SUCCESS:** The core problem has been solved with production-quality code.

**📈 RECOMMENDATION:** Deploy the current version to production. The hybrid architecture, while not ideal long-term, provides a stable foundation that delivers immediate value to users while preserving future refactoring options.

**🔮 FUTURE:** Plan Phase 2 refactoring after gathering user feedback on the new iterative workflow capabilities.
