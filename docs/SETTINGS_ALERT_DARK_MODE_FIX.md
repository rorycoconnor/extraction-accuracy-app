# Settings Alert Box - Dark Mode Fix

## 🐛 Problem

The yellow "Configuration Required" warning alert box on the Settings page was too bright in dark mode, causing visual strain and poor user experience.

**Before:**
- ❌ Bright yellow (`bg-yellow-100`) blinded users in dark mode
- ❌ Hard-coded light mode colors only
- ❌ No dark mode variants
- ❌ Poor contrast and jarring appearance

---

## ✅ Solution

Replaced hard-coded yellow colors with theme-aware variants that are:
- ✅ **Subtle in dark mode** - Uses muted amber/yellow tones
- ✅ **Bright in light mode** - Maintains high visibility
- ✅ **Consistent** - Matches app theme system
- ✅ **Professional** - Proper contrast without eye strain

## 🔧 Changes Made

### File: `src/app/settings/page.tsx`

#### Alert Container (Line 425)
**Before:**
```tsx
<div className="p-3 bg-yellow-100 border border-yellow-200 rounded-md text-sm text-yellow-800">
```

**After:**
```tsx
<div className="p-3 bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-900/20 border border-yellow-200 dark:border-yellow-800/30 rounded-md text-sm text-yellow-800 dark:text-yellow-200">
```

**Changes:**
- Background: `bg-yellow-100` → `dark:bg-yellow-900/20` (very subtle dark yellow with 20% opacity)
- Border: `border-yellow-200` → `dark:border-yellow-800/30` (muted border with 30% opacity)
- Text: `text-yellow-800` → `dark:text-yellow-200` (light yellow text for readability)

---

#### Inline Code Block (Line 427)
**Before:**
```tsx
<code>.env.local</code>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<code className="px-1 py-0.5 bg-yellow-200 dark:bg-yellow-900/40 rounded text-xs">.env.local</code>
```

**Changes:**
- Added subtle background to make code stand out
- Light mode: `bg-yellow-200` (slightly darker yellow)
- Dark mode: `bg-yellow-900/40` (very subtle dark yellow)

---

#### Code Block Container (Line 428)
**Before:**
```tsx
<div className="mt-2 font-mono text-xs">
```

**After:**
```tsx
<div className="mt-2 font-mono text-xs bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-950/30 p-2 rounded border border-yellow-200 dark:border-yellow-800/20">
```

**Changes:**
- Added subtle container background to distinguish code
- Light mode: `bg-yellow-50` (very light yellow)
- Dark mode: `bg-yellow-950/30` (extremely subtle dark background)
- Border for clear separation

## 🎯 Design Principles Applied

1. **Opacity for Subtlety** - Used `/20`, `/30`, `/40` opacity values to create soft glows rather than harsh blocks
2. **Darker Base Colors** - `yellow-900`, `yellow-950` instead of `yellow-100`, `yellow-200`
3. **Lighter Text** - `yellow-200` for text readability on dark backgrounds
4. **Layered Design** - Multiple background layers (alert → code block) for visual hierarchy
5. **Consistent Pattern** - Matches the modal dark mode fixes applied earlier
